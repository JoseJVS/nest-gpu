# NEST GPU microcircuit

This is a NEST GPU implementation of the microcircuit model by Potjans and Diesmann [1]_.
The network model represents four layers of cortex, L2/3, L4, L5, and L6, each consisting of a population of excitatory neurons and a population of inhibitory neurons.

## Citing this code

If you use this code, we ask you to cite the paper by Potjans and Diesmann [1]_ and the one by Bruno Golosio [2]_.

## File structure

* [run_microcircuit.py](run_microcircuit.py): an example script to try out the microcircuit
* [run_benchmark.py](run_benchmark.py): an example script for benchmarking purposes, adapted from [3]_
* [network.py](network.py): the main Network class with functions to build and simulate the network
* [helpers.py](helpers.py): helper functions for network construction, simulation and evaluation
* [network_params.py](network_params.py): network and neuron parameters
* [stimulus_params.py](stimulus_params.py): parameters for optional external stimulation
* [sim_params.py](sim_params.py): simulation parameters

## Running the simulation

By default, the variables ``N_scaling`` and ``K_scaling`` in ``network_params.py`` are set to
`1.0` (i.e., the full-scale network). ``N_scaling`` adjusts the number of neurons and ``K_scaling`` adjusts the indegrees.
If this is done, the option to print the time progress should be switched off: ``'print_time': False`` in [sim_params.py](sim_params.py).

To run a simulation, simply use:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 run_microcircuit.py

The output will be saved in the ``data`` directory.


## Note on parameters

By default, the simulation uses external Poissonian input to excite all neuronal populations of the microcircuit, i.e., ``poisson_input': True`` in [network_params.py](network_params.py).
If set to ``False``, the Poissonian input is turned off and compensated approximately by calculated direct current (DC) input.
In addition to this ongoing external drive, a thalamic stimulation or a stimulation by an external DC input can be switched on in [stimulus_params.py](stimulus_params.py) (the default for both types of stimuli is ``False``).

The default random initialization of membrane voltages in this simulation uses population-specific means and standard deviations to reduce an initial activity burst in the network: ``'V_type': 'optimized'`` in [network_params.py](network_params.py).
Previous implementations used the same mean and standard deviation for all populations, which is here achieved by setting ``'V_type': 'original'``.

In NEST GPU we implemented the kernel parameter ``remove_conn_key``, which deletes, if ``True``, connection keys after havning organized them. This procedure is useful for optimizing GPU memory consumption, however, it does not allow to get the connections after calibration (the default is ``False``).

## Recommendations for benchmarking

For benchmark simulations assessing network-construction and state-propagation times, some simulation parameters changing is recommented.
You can update the parameters directly in the [run_benchmark.py](run_benchmark.py) script as follows:

.. code-block:: python3

   sim_dict.update({
    't_presim': 0.1, # presimulation time equal to the duration of a single time step. This is needed to trigger the Calibration phase.
    't_sim': 10000., # the biological simulation time should be at least `10` s for measuring the state propagation time.
    'rec_dev': [], # no recording devices.
    'nl_algo': 0, #BlockStep nested loop algorithm is the fastest for NVIDIA A100, but algorithm speed depends on the GPU card and the architecture.
   })

Also network parameters can similarly be updated, as can be seen in [L99](run_benchmark.py#L99).

The benchmarking scripts are adapted from [3]_. See also the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gmtiddia/ngpu_dynamic_network_creation/tree/main/ngpu_microcircuit)
for a detailed description of the simulation files. To run the benchmarking script you should write:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 run_benchmark.py

A JSON file is returned as output, containing simulation information and the values of the Python timers for each simulation task performed. Times are expresses in nanoseconds. More simulation options can be seen by typing:

.. code-block:: bash

   python3 run_benchmark.py -h

To perform a set of simulations for benchmarking, we provide as example the script [run_benchmark.sh](run_benchmark.sh). It performs 10 simulations of the microcircuit
using different seed for random number generation, storing all the data in a folder named ``sim_output``. Run the set of simulations using:

.. code-block:: bash

   bash run_benchmark.sh
