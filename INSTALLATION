Tested on ubuntu 18.04-19.10 and on other unix/linux-based systems.
Prerequisites:
1) Up-to-date nvidia drivers
2) packages: nvidia-cuda-toolkit openmpi-bin libopenmpi-dev libomp-dev python python-matplotlib python-mpi4py (those are the names in ubuntu, may have different names in other linux/unix distributions).


Configuration and installation
On a terminal, cd to the folder where you unpacked the tarball, and type:
./configure
make
sudo make install

If you have problems that are not related to missing packages, before the "./configure command try to type:
autoreconf -i
and then the same commands written above.
