In spike_mpi.cu the kernel
__global__ void SendExternalSpike()
should be copied/pasted in two kernels:
1) the first for counting spikes per remote target host;
2) The second for filling the array
replace the internal loop with the approach proposed by Partick Atkins(on?)


after counting (1) use the prefix scan
(as in JoinSpikes line 492 to evaluate the first index of each target host in the 1D array. Maybe rename d_ExternalTargetSpikeCumul to
d_ExternalTargetSpikeIdx0

ExternalTargetSpikeNodeIdJoin should replace ExternalTargetSpikeNodeId,
which therefore becomes a compact 1D array rather than a 2D array with empty spaces in the rowe

In the calibration size ExternalTargetSpikeNodeId properly
(maybe using maximum average rate?)
